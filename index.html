          Liberty Walk was established by Wataru Kato when he was 26 years old.
          The business was first operated in a small vehicle lot where they
          could only exhibit 3 cars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Liberty Walk has evolved throughout its history into one of the
          biggest names in automotive tuning. Put simply, there is no other
          brand out there being quite so brave, or seemingly capturing the
          current tuning zeitgeist as this brand.

          While keeping with the proud tradition of Japan Grand Champion
          Series Silhouette Cars, Liberty Walk have revolutionised the way LB-Works
          cars are built! With the LB Silhouette Works GT range every panel
          on the car, with the exception of the roof and doors, will now be
          available with the new innovative wide-body full panel
          replacements.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is Liberty Walk’s unique Japanese background and years of custom
          car building that has brought Liberty Walk to the point it is at
          today. As a new part of the LB-Works line-up, LB Silhouette Works GT
          will continue to define Liberty Walk for years to come.
